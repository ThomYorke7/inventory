# The BoardGameNerd Inventory

This is a basic CRUD application I built for the Odin Project using the MERN stack and Bootstrap. 

This project helped me learning how to create dynamic pages, build a server and connect the frontend with the backend.
I also learnt to upload files through forms using Multer, to redirect using react-router-dom and to deploy on Heroku.

The application is available here: https://boardgamenerd.herokuapp.com/
